# Nickel.js

An RTS game engine built over SimpleGame.js (by Andrew Harris). It is being writtin in Javascript and HTML5 using the canvas element. Developement is currently completed. I probably will not work on this project any longer; rather, I will work on new projects possibly similar to this one.

# Nickel.js

An RTS game engine built over SimpleGame.js (by Andrew Harris). It is being writtin in Javascript and HTML5 using the canvas element. Developement is currently completed. I probably will not work on this project any longer; rather, I will work on new projects possibly similar to this one.

## Art

All by me using MS Paint and Photoshop. If you look carefully, you will realize much of the art in the game is careless though. The focus was more on the functionality.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the game:
 - unpack all contents into some directory
 - run "test2.html" on Chrome for best compatability

KNOW THESE IF YOU WANT TO WIN THE GAME:
 - left click to select unit
 - ctrl + left click to selct multiple units
 - right click to move units to a tile
 - if you right click an impossible spot, unit may go somewhere else
 - select units at ui bar and then click your factory (blue) to produce units
 - units cost gold
 - blue unit shoots slow many weak bullets
 - red unit shoots fast, high-damage, far ranged bullets (use them alot!)
 - wall units cannot attack but have lots of health so use them to block enemys
 - spaceship units are very strong and do all kinds of damage

About:
 - Nickel.js is the game engine I made. test2.html is the game I made using Nickel.js. Nickel.js is a sort of wrapper around simpleGame.js. Some features are a little buggy which are easily fixable, but I think I did my part for this one, so I'm just going to leave it alone.

What I want to Improve:
 - I want to fix the scrolling
 - I want to to some major improvemtns on pathfinding especially efficiency (use Heap, index)
 - I want to do overall improvements on the Software Design of the project
 - Make the engine easier to use
 - Add more objects to encapsulate complexity
 - make complex algorithms stand alone from objects
 - want to add more units, more factories, more special events and effects, sound, etc.
